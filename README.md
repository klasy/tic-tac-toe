# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game in python 2.7
GUI is implemented with the help of Tkinter library


To run the solution:
1. Please, be sure to check that Python is installed on your system (on Linux and Mac it's there by defualt);
2. Check the version of Python you have on your system with "python --version". It should say either of 2: Python 2.7.x or Python 3.x.x;
3. for this solution the Python 2.7 version was used, so you need precisely this version to run it. If you already have 3.x installed, it would not hurt to install 2.7 along. You just need to be carefull with the PATH variable.
4. also we would need the Tkinter library installed. Please, follow the instruction here: http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html - again there's an example for the Python 3.4 while I used Python 2.7. On Ubuntu it's "sudo apt-get install python-tk"
5. after everything is installed we are ready to run the game - there are 2 ways, choose either you like:
5.a. make file "tic-tac-toe.py" executable with "chmod +x tic-tac-toe.py" or in properties of the file in Windows. And in Linux or Mac: "./tic-tac-toe.py" or double click in Windows;
5.b. run "python tic-tac-toe.py". If the python 2.7 was installed additionally on the system you may want to provide the full path to the Python executable unless you are comfortable with setting up the pth to it into the PATH variable.
